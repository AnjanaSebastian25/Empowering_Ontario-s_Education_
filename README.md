7.Outcome Testing 
I tried to find the different metrics in that reflect towards the network performance of the school boards like latency , Bandwidth, download satisfaction, upload satisfaction, packet error status, and availability. I even used the ELM model for the bandwidth prediction. I conducted a thorough network performance testing of the k-12 Ontario school boards using Bandwidth dashboard and the Map dashboard for various locations in the province. 
I built an Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) model to predict the bandwidth in the future. ELM can give a more accurate result with a smaller dataset size, which will also decrease the learning time of the model [3].
To test the accuracy of the model, I split the dataset to training set and testing set. I used the training set to build the model, the testing set will be used to measure the accuracy of the model. Since bandwidth prediction is a regression model, I calculated the mean squared error (MSE) betIen the testing data and the predictions. The MSE measures the amount of the error and will increase with the model error increase [4], the results show a value of 0.00232, which is acceptable because it is close to 0.
With the model I can predict the bandwidth in the future, this will help us to plan the upgrade of bandwidth for schools. For example, if there will be a activity for a school which will require a wide bandwidth to support the activity, and I predict that the bandwidth in future will not be enough, I can enhance the priority of that school while I make plans.
I also plan to connect the python ELM code to the PoIr BI, so I can see the data visualization in the poIr BI, which can give us ability to see the trend of bandwidth use and rank the top 10 school with smaller bandwidth which will also help us to make future.
I think the ELM will be a good model for the business problem because it does not need the generous size of data as I mentioned previously, and the shorter time means when I make the real-time monitoring of the school network data, I will see the change more on time.

In the outcome testing one of the crucial factors to include was the stake holders review and feedback which Ire Ministry of Education (Project Sponsor), School Board Administrators, IT Teams within Schools and School Boards, Government Authorities (Policy Makers), Technology Solution Providers. These all are considered for the dashboard evaluation and change requirements. Based on the outcome testing I made the necessary changes and tried to get the optimized results.

 After that I Documented the results of the outcome testing phase in a comprehensive report. Included the findings, comparisons betIen predicted and actual performance, insights from the ELM algorithm, dashboard feedback, and any recommendations for further enhancements.

8. Potential Solution Optimization
The current Network Performance Analytics Solution for K12 Ontario school boards is to deliver accurate insights and improve broadband connectivity, where there are several ways for future enhancements that can further improve its impact and address evolving needs.
The solution's monitoring capabilities would be improved by adding real-time data updates. Network administrators can rapidly see changes in network performance, rises in traffic, or potential problems that need prompt action by receiving daily data updates. Additionally, by identifying locations with high utilisation, real-time data can enable the dynamic management of network traffic. Administrators can decide to prohibit or restrict access to Ibsites with this knowledge, maximising network restheces and providing a better user experience. Taking the visualization, a step further, enhancing the dashboard to allow drilling down to the school level would provide critical insights. This granular analysis enables administrators to assess each school's network activity individually. By examining performance metrics, traffic patterns, and potential issues at the school level, administrators can identify specific needs and tailor solutions accordingly. This approach promotes targeted interventions and customization of network management strategies based on the unique requirements of each school. 
Also, by gathering continuous feedback from stakeholders and refining the dashboard's user interface would ensure that insights are communicated effectively. By catering to user needs and preferences, the dashboard can become a poIrful decision-making tool. Facilitating collaboration betIen network administrators, IT teams, and educators would create a dynamic environment for problem-solving and innovation where the shared insights could lead to quicker issue resolution and more effective network management.
Incorporating machine learning models into the analysis process can provide a new dimension of predictive insights. I think that by harnessing machine learning algorithms, the analytics manager can forecast trends in data usage, helping schools prepare for higher demands or bandwidth issues. These models can predict which schools are more likely to utilize more data or engage in heavier downloads, allowing for proactive resthece allocation and load balancing. In addition to these enhancements, future integrations could extend the solution's scope even further. For instance, integration with cybersecurity tools could booster the solution's ability to identify and mitigate potential threats. Additionally, collaboration with internet service providers could lead to insights into external factors affecting network performance.
By embracing these future enhancements, the Network Performance Analytics Solution can evolve into a dynamic tool that not only addresses current network challenges but also anticipates future needs. Through real-time updates, predictive modeling, and granular analysis, the solution stands raised to revolutionize network management and contribute to an enriched educational experience for all stakeholders involved.
I believe that Introducing cost optimization analysis can help school boards allocate restheces more efficiently by identifying areas where investment can yield the greatest impact. And refining the machine learning models for predictive insights can include more complex algorithms to predict future network performance based on trends and emerging patterns. These future enhancements expand the solution's capabilities and align it more closely with emerging trends and evolving needs in education technology. By staying adaptable and responsive to these enhancements, the Network Performance Analytics Solution can continue to be a valuable tool for improving education outcomes through efficient and reliable network infrastructure. 
 
Conclusion
Overall, the impact analysis indicates that the new solution's successful integration into the current IT infrastructure of Ontario's K–12 school boards will lead to improvements in network performance, data analytics, collaboration, scalability, data security, and cost effectiveness. These beneficial consequences will help the effective administration of the IT infrastructure of the educational system that assist in the provision of high-quality instruction to students, and enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions that will benefit the entire educational community.
I thoroughly tested and revieId the solution throughout the development process to ensure its accuracy, performance, and scalability and I examined the computing cost of the dashboard and comparing various algorithms and data models. Further optimisation of the solution has been considered, where this potential upgrade that might increase its impact. So, this paper provides a thorough description of the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Power BI dashboard created to meet the network performance monitoring requirements of the Ontario Ministry of Education. 
Also, the solution I have created not only fixes the shortcomings of the current dashboard but also builds the path for better network and resthece management, enhancing education in Ontario. Where I provide a user-friendly Power BI dashboard to track and assess the network performance of schools connected to the Ontario School Board Network. This explains the project's key elements and boundaries to make sure it meets the needs and specifications of the Ministry of Education while staying focused on its goals.
